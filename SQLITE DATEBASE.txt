SQLITE DATEBASE 


=====================SQLite - Data Type===================

SQLite Storage Classes

Each value stored in an SQLite database has one of the following storage 



1	NULL

The value is a NULL value.

2	INTEGER

The value is a signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.

3	REAL

The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.

4	TEXT

The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE)

5	BLOB

The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.

=============================SQLite Affinity Typ======================

SQLite supports the concept of type affinity on columns. 
Any column can still store any type of data but the preferred storage class for a column is called its affinity. Each table column 
in an SQLite3 database is assigned one of the following type affinities



1	TEXT
		
		This column stores all data using storage classes NULL, TEXT or BLOB.

2	NUMERIC

		This column may contain values using all five storage classes.

3	INTEGER

		Behaves the same as a column with NUMERIC affinity, with an exception in a CAST expression.

4	REAL

		Behaves like a column with NUMERIC affinity except that it forces integer values into floating point representation.

5	NONE

		A column with affinity NONE does not prefer one storage class over another and no attempt is made to coerce data from one storage class into another.

==================Boolean Datatype===============

QLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class. Instead, 
Boolean values are stored as integers 0 (false) and 1 (true).
